    The Cantarell font family is designed as a contemporary Humanist sans serif
    and is particularly designed for on-screen reading on mobile devices at
    small sizes, such as phones and tablets.

    This is the open font officially chosen by default for the GNOME 3 desktop
    and for Fedora branding materials.

    Regular and bold weights are provided for now. Italics are planned.

    Each font file currently contains 391 glyphs, and fully support the
    following writing systems: Basic Latin, Western European, Catalan, Baltic,
    Turkish, Central European, Dutch and Afrikaans.
