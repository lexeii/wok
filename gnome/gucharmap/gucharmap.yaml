    The Character Map application allows you to insert special characters into a
    document or a text field. Character Map provides accented characters,
    mathematical symbols, special symbols, and punctuation marks. Use Character
    Map to access characters that are not available on your keyboard.

    Character Map displays all the characters are available in all of the
    language scripts on your system, using the Unicode character set. Unicode is
    a character set standard with the goal to include all of the characters that
    are used in all of the written languages in the world.
