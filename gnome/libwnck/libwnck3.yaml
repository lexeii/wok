    libwnck is Window Navigator Construction Kit, i.e. a library to use for
    writing pagers and taskslists and stuff.

    libwnck is not supported in the devel platform, which means OS vendors won't
    guarantee the API/ABI long-term, but authors of open source apps should feel
    free to use libwnck as users can always recompile against a new version. The
    API/ABI has historically changed very little: libwnck authors are not
    changing it gratuitously or without soname increments.
