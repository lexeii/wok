    In Quadrapassel, the GNOME version of Tetris, your goal is to create as many
    complete horizontal lines as possible. The lines are made from seven
    different shapes. The shapes fall randomly from the top center of the
    screen. Your task is to rotate and move the shapes across the screen to make
    complete lines. By making complete horizontal lines, you score points and
    move up levels. As you progress, the speed of the falling blocks increases.
