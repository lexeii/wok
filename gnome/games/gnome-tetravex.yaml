    GNOME Tetravex is a simple puzzle game which scope is to move the various
    pieces from one side of the board to the other side, so that the same
    numbers depicted on the pieces are touching each other.

    The game is timed, and these times are used as the score for the game. You
    have to move all the pieces in the least time possible.
