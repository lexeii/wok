    GnuPG Made Easy (GPGME) is a C language library that allows to add support for
    cryptography to a program. It is designed to make access to public key crypto
    engines like GnuPG or GpgSM easier for applications. GPGME provides a
    high-level crypto API for encryption, decryption, signing, signature
    verification and key management.

    GPGME uses GnuPG and GpgSM as its backends to support OpenPGP and the
    Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS).
