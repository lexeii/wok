    DirMngr - X.509 Directory Manager

    DirMngr is a server for managing and downloading certificate revocation lists
    (CRLs) for X.509 certificates and for downloading the certificates themselves.
    Dirmngr also handles OCSP requests as an alternative to CRLs. Dirmngr is
    either invoked internally by gpgsm (GnuPG-2) or when running as a system
    daemon through the dirmngr-client tool.

    Note that GnuPG includes an updated Dirmngr starting with GnuPG 2.1. Do not
    expect that this standalone Dirmngr package will be maintained in the future.
