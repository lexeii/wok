    nPth - The New GNU Portable Threads Library

    This is a library to provide the GNU Pth API and thus a non-preemptive threads
    implementation.

    In contrast to GNU Pth is is based on the system's standard threads
    implementation. This allows the use of libraries which are not compatible to
    GNU Pth. Experience with a Windows Pth emulation showed that this is a solid
    way to provide a co-routine based framework.
