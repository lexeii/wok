  description: |
    The XCB util modules provides a number of libraries which sit on top of
    libxcb, the core X protocol library, and some of the extension libraries.
    These experimental libraries provide convenience functions and interfaces
    which make the raw X protocol more usable. Some of the libraries also provide
    client-side code which is not strictly part of the X protocol but which have
    traditionally been provided by Xlib.
